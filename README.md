# Bitbucket Commit To Trello Cards

This repository is Bitbucket 's Webhook API to link Bitbucket' s commit and Trello 's cards.

You can do the same with zapier, but it takes time to reflect from commit to card. By using this repository mechanism, it can be reflected almost in real time.

## Getting Started

### Trello Settings

Generate a Trello's key and token for Bitbucket.

1. Generate a key.
    * [https://trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key)
2. Generate a token. (replace {GENERATED KEY}.)
    * [https://trello.com/1/authorize?key={GENERATED KEY}&name=&expiration=never&response_type=token&scope=read,write](https://trello.com/1/authorize?key={GENERATED KEY}&name=&expiration=never&response_type=token&scope=read,write)

### Installing

Replace Trello's key and token on serverless.yml.

```
functions:
  webhook:
    handler: handler.webhook
    environment:
      TRELLO_KEY: {GENERATED KEY}     <- replace it.
      TRELLO_TOKEN: {GENERATED TOKEN} <- replace it.
```

Install the stack and memory ServiceEndpoint.

```
$ npm install
$ serverless deploy -v
~
ServiceEndpoint: https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev
